### Hello ðŸ‘‹
I am a **Java** developer with a background in QA automation. I am an effective worker and am ready for any type of work. However, my **unique** skill lies in my deep knowledge of PC hardware, along with several years of experience primarily focusing on bulk orders for office PC assembly. Additionally, I am proficient in other areas, including C# and various testing frameworks. My interests encompass cosmic informatics, mobile development, and optimizing tools and features in old-school games.

### Highlighting my skills and abilities with some projects
I've been putting off starting to publish my code publicly for a while. Well, here we go! I'll make an effort to regularly add to it and maintain it. I added project **Consistency increaser** related to decision theory and a portion of the working code for the indie-game **Evil Potions**, which is currently in development.
#### Consistency increaser 
In simple terms, this project is designed to process large volumes of strictly ordered data represented as binary matrices at high speed. It assists in handling datasets and achieving a consistent order of alternatives. Areas where my project can be beneficial include:
- Astronomical research in big data analysis.
- Meteorological research.
- Banking or other systems with extensive unstructured numerical tables, and so on.

The research I have utilized:
1. DOI: 10.1504/IJMDM.2017.10002944
2. DOI: 10.1504/IJMDM.2020.10029719
3. DOI: 10.1016/S0377-2217(02)00227-8
4. DOI:10.1016/S0305-0548(03)00022-4 (...)

Algoritm:

#### Indie-game Evil Potions
**Release date ~02 or 03.2024*

An indie game about an evil alchemist trying to create the most horrifying potions possible, but it doesn't always work out. That's why sometimes he ends up with potions that have a positive effect when he's not even trying.

Examples of developed level and character models:

You can try experimenting with the potion-making algorithm and effects; you can find it here: [EvilPotions](https://github.com/mykhailo-arkhipov/EvilPotions)

I don't plan to release the code of the game publicly, but I'd be happy to share it with anyone interested. Just reach out to me on LinkedIn or through other contact methods.
